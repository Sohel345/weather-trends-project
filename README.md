Analysis and comparison of  Bangalore city's temperature and global temperature 


The goal here is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and Bangalore city's temperature. To do this, the following steps have been followed:

A line chart is been created that compares Bangalore city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. The moving average is plotted in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable
Observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends are made.
Some questions that has been analysed are:
  Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
  “How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
  What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few 
  hundred years?
